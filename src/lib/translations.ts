Delving into freelancing in 2015, I embarked on a journey marked by exploration and innovation. My keen eye for aesthetics drives me to craft visually captivating experiences across various mediums. Beyond my primary disciplines, I dabble in web development, enriching my skill set and pushing the boundaries of digital artistry in my free time.",
            description2: " Fueled by a diverse palette of influences, I infuse my creative endeavors with the pulsating rhythms and eclectic melodies of dubstep, drum & bass, rock, and rap. Music isn't just a background soundtrack for me - it's a driving force, inspiring my designs and cinematography with its energy and emotion. Whether I'm crafting 3D art, making intuitive UI interfaces, or capturing the perfect shot through my lens, the synergy between my passion for design and love for music shapes every project I undertake.",

Rozpoczynając pracę jako freelancer w 2015 roku, wyruszyłem w podróż pełną eksploracji i innowacji. Moje wyczucie estetyki motywuje mnie do tworzenia wizualnie urzekających doświadczeń w różnych mediach. Poza moimi głównymi dyscyplinami, zajmuję się tworzeniem stron internetowych, rozwijając swoje umiejętności i przesuwając granice sztuki cyfrowej w wolnym czasie.",
            description2: "Napędzany różnorodną paletą wpływów, wypełniam swoje kreatywne przedsięwzięcia pulsującymi rytmami i eklektycznymi melodiami dubstepu, drum & bassu, rocka i rapu. Muzyka to dla mnie nie tylko ścieżka dźwiękowa – to siła napędowa, inspirująca moje projekty i kinematografię swoją energią i emocjami. Niezależnie od tego, czy rzeźbię trójwymiarowe krajobrazy, tworzę intuicyjne interfejsy użytkownika, czy też robię idealne zdjęcie obiektywem, synergia między moją pasją do projektowania i miłością do muzyki kształtuje każdy projekt, którego się podejmuję.",

Daje jasne wskazówki, dzięki którym nawet osoba bez doświadczenia w modelingu dokładnie wie, co robi i czuje się swobodnie przed obiektywem. Ma doskonałe oko do detali i potrafi wydobyć z człowieka to, co najlepsze — efektem są bardzo udane zdjęcia. Zdecydowanie polecam!"
